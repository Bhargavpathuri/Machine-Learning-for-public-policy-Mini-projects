# MLPP 2025 Mini Projects

This repository contains six mini projects developed as part of the **Machine Learning for Public Policy (MLPP) 2025** course. Each project applies machine learning techniques to real-world datasets to address socially impactful policy questions across health, economics, urban planning, public safety, and the environment.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

* **MLPP\_Mini Projects**
  Contains all six project Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`), each including detailed code and clear explanations.

* **MLPP\_Mini projects datasets and shapefiles**
  Contains all necessary datasets and shapefiles required to run the notebooks.

## üìö Mini Projects Overview

### 1. **Diabetes Risk: Predicting Outcomes in Homogeneous Populations**

Explores predictive modeling on health data to assess diabetes risk using logistic regression and classification metrics. Focuses on fairness and biases within demographic groups.

### 2. **NYC Stop and Frisk: Predictors of Outcomes**

Analyzes NYC stop-and-frisk data to model outcomes such as arrest likelihood. Emphasizes understanding the role of race, location, and behavior in predictive policing.

### 3. **Outcomes of Gentrification: Local Changes to Median Income**

Uses spatial and socioeconomic data to model how gentrification affects neighborhood-level income changes over time, applying regression and geospatial analysis.

### 4. **Ridership of Urban Bike Shares: The Case of Citi Bike in NYC**

Investigates factors influencing bike-share usage in NYC. Utilizes time series analysis and regression techniques to model ridership trends and their correlates.

### 5. **Sea Level Rise: Projections for the Future**

Applies modeling techniques to environmental data for forecasting sea level rise. Explores scenario analysis and uncertainty quantification in long-term environmental planning.

### 6. **Zip Codes Business Patterns: Economic Trends Across Geographies**

Explores trends in business activity across different zip codes using clustering and dimensionality reduction to reveal patterns in economic development.
